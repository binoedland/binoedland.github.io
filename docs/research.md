#### Macaulay2 code

Some Macaulay2 code i wrote for various algebraic geometry projects. The code is not well written, and some of it may even be incompatible with current versions of Macaulay2.

###### Toric Vector Bundles 
Macaulay2 code I wrote for computing parliaments of polytopes of toric vector bundles: 
A package [Parliament.m2](/M2/Parliament.m2):
[Examples](/M2/examplesParliament.m2) from Di Rocco-Jabbusch-Smith's article illustrating its use: 

###### Local Euler obstructions of WPS
Macaulay2 code I wrote for computing local Euler obstructions and degrees of dual varieties for weighted projective surfaces and threefolds.
