## Algebraic geometry

My research in algebraic geometry is within the field of toric geometry. It is a subfield were one studies algebraic varieties with a praticular kind of group action by an algebraic torus. Using this group action one establishes links between algebraic geometry and combinatorics, thus enabling one to study algebraic varieties via studying combinatorial objects such as lattice polytopes and rational polyhedral fans.

### Macaulay2 code

Here is some Macaulay2 code I wrote for various algebraic geometry projects. The code is not well written, and some of it may even be incompatible with current versions of Macaulay2.

#### Toric Vector Bundles 
Macaulay2 code I wrote for computing parliaments of polytopes of toric vector bundles: 

A package [Parliament.m2](/M2/Parliament.m2) and [Examples](/M2/examplesParliament.m2) from Di Rocco-Jabbusch-Smith's article illustrating its use.

#### Local Euler obstructions of WPS
Macaulay2 code I wrote for computing local Euler obstructions and degrees of dual varieties for weighted projective surfaces and threefolds: A package [EulerObstructionWPS.m2](/M2/EulerObstructionWPS.m2) and the [examples](/M2/examplesEulerObWPS.m2) appearing in my article "Local Euler obstructions of toric varieties".
